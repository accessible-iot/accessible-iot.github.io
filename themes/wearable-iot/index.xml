By making the designs and schematics freely available, the research enables a wide range of applications in health monitoring, cognitive state detection, and accessibility tools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The platform supports various biopotential signals including EOG (electrooculography), EMG (electromyography), and ECG (electrocardiography), all captured from the ear region. This positions OpenEarable as a key enabling technology for the Internet of Things in healthcare and accessibility contexts.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>A Novel Sensing Method and Its Empirical Study for Vocal Technique Analysis of Singing Pitch Control: Combining Surface EMG with Ultrasonography</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/chen2024novel/</link><pubDate>Thu, 04 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/chen2024novel/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces a novel sensing method that combines surface EMG with ultrasonography to analyze vocal techniques during singing pitch control. The multimodal approach provides deeper insights into the physiological mechanisms of singing and opens new possibilities for vocal training systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Soma Express Kit</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kanda2023soma/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kanda2023soma/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This research introduces an innovative approach to understanding and sharing the embodied experiences of people with visual impairments. The Soma Express Kit uses IoT sensors and multi-sensory feedback to create new channels of communication between people with and without visual impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By embracing the somaesthetic potential of people with visual impairments, this work fosters empathy and enables richer collaborative cross-ability interactions. The toolkit represents a significant contribution to inclusive IoT design, moving beyond traditional assistive technology paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Affective Umbrella--A Wearable System to Visualize Heart and Electrodermal Activity, towards Emotion Regulation through Somaesthetic Appreciation</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/chen2023affective/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/chen2023affective/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;The Affective Umbrella is a wearable system that visualizes heart and electrodermal activity in real-time. The work explores how somaesthetic appreciation of one&amp;rsquo;s own physiological signals can support emotion regulation and self-awareness.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>First Bite/Chew: distinguish typical allergic food by two IMUs</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/li2023first/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/li2023first/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This paper presents a wearable system using two IMU sensors to detect typical allergic foods by analyzing bite and chew patterns. The work offers a novel approach to food allergy detection that could help users avoid allergen exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Affective Umbrella--Towards a Novel Sensor Integrated Multimedia Platform Using Electrodermal and Heart Activity in an Umbrella Handle</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/chen2021affective/</link><pubDate>Fri, 26 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/chen2021affective/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces the Affective Umbrella, a novel platform that integrates electrodermal and heart activity sensors into an umbrella handle. The system explores unobtrusive physiological monitoring in everyday situations, turning a common object into a wearable sensing device.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
