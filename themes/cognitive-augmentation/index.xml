Building on the first workshop, it continues to explore mobile technologies for cognitive augmentation within human-centered AI frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>BodyPursuits</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/hansen2025bodypursuits/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/hansen2025bodypursuits/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This research explores how the natural eye movement pattern of smooth pursuit can be used for interaction with IoT systems and wearable devices. By tracking how users&amp;rsquo; eyes follow their own body motions, the system creates new opportunities for hands-free control.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The technique has particular relevance for accessibility, enabling people with limited hand mobility to interact with technology using natural body movements and gaze. It represents an innovative approach to inclusive interface design in the context of ubiquitous computing.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Eye-Tracking for Cognitive Well-Being</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kim2025eye/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kim2025eye/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As eye-tracking becomes increasingly integrated into wearable devices and IoT systems, questions arise about how to ethically monitor and provide feedback about users&amp;rsquo; cognitive states. This research addresses these concerns head-on, proposing design principles that prioritize user autonomy and well-being.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The work is particularly relevant for accessibility applications where cognitive monitoring could support people with attention difficulties, mental health challenges, or neurodivergent individuals, while respecting their privacy and agency.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>MindSpace: Improving Relaxation Break and Performance Using a Device Exterting Tactile Sensation of Life-like Breathing Movement with Squeeze-like Deep Touch Pressure on Users' Upper Chest Area</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kikuchi2025mindspace/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kikuchi2025mindspace/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;MindSpace is a novel device that provides tactile sensations mimicking life-like breathing movements with squeeze-like deep touch pressure on the upper chest area. The system is designed to improve relaxation breaks and enhance performance through calming haptic feedback.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>mobiCHAI 2024: 1st International Workshop on Mobile Cognitive-Augmenting and Cognition-Altering Technologies (CAT) in Human-Centered AI</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/elagroudy2024mobichai/</link><pubDate>Mon, 30 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/elagroudy2024mobichai/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This workshop paper introduces the first International Workshop on Mobile Cognitive-Augmenting and Cognition-Altering Technologies (mobiCHAI). The workshop explores how mobile technologies can augment human cognitive capabilities within human-centered AI frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Ethereal Phenomena-Interactive Art, Meditation, and Breathing Biofeedback: From Mind and Body Wellness Towards Self-Transcendence</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/malaver2022ethereal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/malaver2022ethereal/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This extended work on Ethereal Phenomena presents an interactive art installation that uses breathing biofeedback to facilitate meditation and self-transcendence. The system bridges mind-body wellness practices with technological augmentation through real-time physiological sensing and visualization.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Human--Computer Integration: Towards Integrating the Human Body with the Computational Machine</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/semertzidis2022human/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/semertzidis2022human/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This comprehensive survey paper establishes the theoretical foundations for human-computer integration (HCI), exploring how the human body can be integrated with computational machines. The work provides a framework for understanding and advancing research in human augmentation and embodied interaction.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
