The study reveals intricate verbal and non-verbal signaling strategies that have developed organically in the running community, providing insights for designing better assistive technologies for sports and physical activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key findings include the importance of silence as a form of communication, indicating smooth coordination, and the role of micro-adjustments in maintaining synchronization between runner and guide.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Soma Express Kit</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kanda2023soma/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/kanda2023soma/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This research introduces an innovative approach to understanding and sharing the embodied experiences of people with visual impairments. The Soma Express Kit uses IoT sensors and multi-sensory feedback to create new channels of communication between people with and without visual impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By embracing the somaesthetic potential of people with visual impairments, this work fosters empathy and enables richer collaborative cross-ability interactions. The toolkit represents a significant contribution to inclusive IoT design, moving beyond traditional assistive technology paradigms.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Seeing our Blind Spots</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/zhang2022seeing/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Oct 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/zhang2022seeing/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Traditional visual impairment simulation tools are static and fail to account for dynamic eye movements. This research introduces a smart glasses-based system that provides realistic, dynamic simulations of various visual impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The system was evaluated with design students, demonstrating significant improvements in their awareness and understanding of visual accessibility challenges. Questionnaires and qualitative feedback confirmed that the dynamic, eye-movement-aware simulation helped participants develop more empathetic and informed approaches to inclusive design.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
