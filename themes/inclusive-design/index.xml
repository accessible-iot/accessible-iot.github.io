The system provides innovative haptic feedback for navigation, improving accessibility in virtual reality and enabling users to experience spatial awareness similar to biological echo-location.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>TIEboard: A Digital Educational Tool for Kids Geometric Learning</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/zaidi2025tieboard/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/zaidi2025tieboard/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;TIEboard represents an innovative approach to making mathematics education more accessible and inclusive for children. By combining tangible interaction with digital feedback, the tool creates an engaging learning environment that supports diverse learning styles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research demonstrates how IoT-enabled educational tools can bridge the gap between abstract mathematical concepts and concrete, hands-on learning experiences.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Sticking With Electronics for Crafting Practices</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/barbareschi2025sticking/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/barbareschi2025sticking/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This work addresses the digital divide by making electronics and IoT creation accessible to older adults. Through carefully designed crafting activities that incorporate electronics, the research shows how older adults can develop technical literacy while engaging in creative, meaningful activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings have important implications for inclusive design in IoT, showing that with appropriate support and methods, technology creation can be made accessible across age groups and technical backgrounds.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Speech is Silver, Silence is Golden</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/barbareschi2024speech/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/barbareschi2024speech/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This groundbreaking research explores the subtle communication patterns that enable visually impaired runners and their guides to move together effectively. The study reveals intricate verbal and non-verbal signaling strategies that have developed organically in the running community, providing insights for designing better assistive technologies for sports and physical activities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key findings include the importance of silence as a form of communication, indicating smooth coordination, and the role of micro-adjustments in maintaining synchronization between runner and guide.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>I am both here and there</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/barbareschi2023robotic/</link><pubDate>Sun, 23 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/barbareschi2023robotic/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;A groundbreaking study conducted in a real café environment where disabled workers operated multiple robotic avatars in parallel. The research demonstrates that people with disabilities possess specific competencies that enhance their ability to manage multiple embodied presences simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings have significant implications for employment opportunities and workplace accessibility, showing how assistive robotics can create new forms of meaningful work for people with mobility impairments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work was featured in multiple accessibility newsletters and demonstrates the practical application of IoT and robotics in creating inclusive workspaces.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Towards Applying Pneumatic Gel Muscles to Augment Plantar Flexor Muscle Stretching for Children with Cerebral Palsy</title><link>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/chen2022towards/</link><pubDate>Sun, 27 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://accessible-iot.org/publications/chen2022towards/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This paper explores the potential of Pneumatic Gel Muscles (PGM) technology for assisting children with cerebral palsy. The work investigates how soft actuators can be used to augment plantar flexor muscle stretching, offering a novel approach to rehabilitation therapy.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
