    <h2 id="story">Project Success Story</h2>
    <div class="success-story">
        <h3>Building Inclusive Technologies: A Journey Toward Accessible IoT</h3>

        <p>The JST Presto project "Accessibility Assessment Toolkit for Inclusive IoT Design" represents a transformative approach to making Internet of Things (IoT) technologies truly accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities. Launched in 2021, this research initiative addresses a critical gap: while IoT systems permeate our daily lives, their accessibility is often left to individual developers with limited guidance or standardized assessment tools.</p>

        <p><strong>Why This Project Succeeded:</strong></p>

        <p>The project's success stems from its holistic, human-centered approach that combines multiple research methodologies:</p>

        <p><strong>1. Empathy-Driven Design:</strong> Rather than designing accessibility features in isolation, the research team developed innovative simulation tools that allow designers and developers to experience the world from the perspective of users with visual impairments. The "Seeing our Blind Spots" smart glasses-based simulation (Zhang et al., 2022) exemplifies this approach, enabling design students to viscerally understand the challenges faced by visually impaired users. This experiential learning proved far more effective than traditional accessibility guidelines alone.</p>

        <p><strong>2. Real-World Validation:</strong> The project grounded its research in authentic use cases, studying how people with disabilities navigate real-world scenarios. For instance, the analysis of micro-communication strategies between visually impaired runners and their guides (Barbareschi et al., 2024) provided insights that informed the design of more intuitive IoT assistance systems. Similarly, the study of disabled workers using robotic avatars in a café (Barbareschi et al., 2023) demonstrated how IoT and telepresence technologies can create new employment opportunities.</p>

        <p><strong>3. Somaesthetic Understanding:</strong> The Soma Express Kit (Kanda & Kunze, 2023) introduced a novel approach to understanding accessibility by exploring the somaesthetic experiences of people with visual impairments—how they perceive and experience the world through their bodies. This research revealed that accessibility goes beyond functional adaptations; it encompasses the entire sensory and emotional experience of interacting with technology.</p>

        <p><strong>4. Cross-Domain Innovation:</strong> The project didn't limit itself to traditional accessibility domains. Work on IoT device design for health monitoring (Szyszka et al., 2023) demonstrated how the accessibility toolkit principles could be applied to critical health applications, showing the broader impact of inclusive design thinking.</p>

        <p><strong>Key Achievements:</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>Developed validated simulation tools for accessibility assessment that allow designers to experience visual impairments firsthand</li>
            <li>Created frameworks for understanding and implementing accessibility in IoT systems using on-body sensing</li>
            <li>Published influential research at top-tier venues (CHI, UIST, IoT Conference) that shaped the field's understanding of inclusive IoT design</li>
            <li>Established partnerships between academia, industry, and disability communities to ensure research relevance</li>
            <li>Demonstrated practical applications in employment, sports, health monitoring, and daily living</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Impact and Legacy:</strong></p>

        <p>This project's impact extends beyond academic publications. It has:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Influenced how designers approach accessibility in IoT development</li>
            <li>Provided practical tools and methodologies that can be adopted by industry</li>
            <li>Raised awareness about the importance of inclusive design in emerging technologies</li>
            <li>Created opportunities for people with disabilities to participate more fully in society through better-designed IoT systems</li>
            <li>Established a foundation for the next generation of accessibility research</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The project's success demonstrates that accessibility is not a constraint but an opportunity for innovation. By centering the experiences of users with diverse abilities, the research team developed insights and tools that benefit all users, embodying the principle that inclusive design leads to better design for everyone.</p>

        <p>As IoT systems continue to evolve and permeate more aspects of daily life, the Accessibility Assessment Toolkit provides essential infrastructure for ensuring these technologies serve all members of society, moving us closer to the inclusive future envisioned in the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.</p>

        <div class="paper-venue">Proceedings of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2024), pp. 1-16</div>
        <div class="paper-summary">
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This ethnographic study examines the subtle communication strategies employed between visually impaired runners and their sighted guides during running activities. Through detailed observation and analysis, the researchers identified a rich vocabulary of verbal and non-verbal communication patterns that enable safe and effective collaboration.</p>

            <p>The research reveals that effective guidance involves not just explicit verbal instructions but also a sophisticated system of micro-communications including tether tension, breathing patterns, footfall synchronization, and minimal verbal cues. Interestingly, guides and runners develop personalized communication systems over time, optimizing for efficiency and trust.</p>

            <p>These findings have significant implications for designing assistive IoT systems. The study shows that effective assistance is often about providing the right information at the right time with minimal cognitive load, rather than constant verbose guidance. The insights inform the design of wearable devices and IoT systems that can support similar collaborative activities.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Provides empirical evidence of how visually impaired individuals navigate dynamic environments through multi-modal communication, offering design principles for IoT-based assistance systems that respect users' autonomy and expertise.</p>

            <p><strong>Relevance to Grant:</strong> Demonstrates how understanding real-world accessibility needs can inform the design and assessment of on-body sensing systems for inclusive IoT, a core objective of the JST Presto grant.</p>

        <div class="paper-summary">
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces the Soma Express Kit, a novel toolkit designed to help researchers and designers understand the somaesthetic experiences—the lived, bodily experiences—of people with visual impairments. The kit provides structured methods for exploring how visually impaired individuals perceive, navigate, and experience their environment through non-visual senses.</p>

            <p>The research emphasizes that accessibility is not merely about compensating for vision loss but about understanding and supporting the rich, multi-sensory ways that visually impaired people engage with the world. The Soma Express Kit guides users through exercises that highlight tactile, auditory, proprioceptive, and kinesthetic dimensions of experience.</p>

            <p>Through workshops using the kit, the researchers found that participants (both sighted and visually impaired) gained deeper appreciation for the complexity and sophistication of non-visual perception. This understanding is crucial for designing IoT systems that genuinely support rather than replace or diminish users' existing capabilities.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Offers a practical methodology for somaesthetic inquiry in accessibility research, shifting focus from deficit-based models to experience-centered design approaches.</p>

            <p><strong>Relevance to Grant:</strong> Directly addresses the grant's focus on using on-body sensing to assess accessibility by providing methods to understand how people with disabilities experience sensing and embodiment, essential for designing appropriate assessment tools.</p>

        <div class="paper-venue">Proceedings of the Augmented Humans International Conference 2023, pp. 231-242</div>
        <div class="paper-summary">
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This paper introduces the Affective Umbrella, an innovative wearable system that makes invisible physiological states visible through ambient display. The umbrella visualizes the wearer's heart rate and electrodermal activity (EDA) in real-time using LED patterns, creating a bridge between internal emotional states and external perception.</p>

            <p>The research explores somaesthetic appreciation—the conscious attention to and appreciation of one's own bodily experiences—as a mechanism for emotion regulation. Unlike traditional biofeedback systems that present numerical data, the Affective Umbrella uses abstract, aesthetic visualizations that encourage reflection without judgment. This approach aligns with mindfulness practices and embodied cognition theories.</p>

            <p>User studies demonstrated that participants became more aware of their emotional states when using the umbrella, with many reporting a calming effect from observing their physiological patterns. The ambient nature of the display allowed for passive monitoring during daily activities, reducing the cognitive burden often associated with self-monitoring technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Demonstrates how wearable IoT devices can support emotional well-being through somaesthetic awareness rather than explicit intervention, offering a gentler approach to emotion regulation technology.</p>

            <p><strong>Relevance to Grant:</strong> Exemplifies the grant's emphasis on on-body sensing for accessibility and user experience assessment, showing how IoT wearables can be designed to enhance self-awareness and wellbeing in an accessible, non-intrusive manner.</p>

        <div class="paper-venue">2021 International Symposium on Wearable Computers, pp. 48-52</div>
        <div class="paper-summary">
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This paper presents an innovative approach to reducing motion sickness in virtual reality and vehicle travel using dynamically-controlled smart glasses. The system selectively blocks peripheral vision while maintaining clear central vision, based on the principle that motion sickness often results from conflicting sensory information between visual and vestibular systems.</p>

            <p>The research builds on prior work showing that restricting peripheral vision can reduce motion sickness, but innovates by making this restriction dynamic and adaptive. The glasses use liquid crystal displays to create a "tunnel vision" effect that adjusts in real-time based on motion intensity or user preference. This allows users to experience immersive content while minimizing discomfort.</p>

            <p>Evaluation studies showed significant reduction in motion sickness symptoms compared to unrestricted viewing, with users reporting improved comfort during both VR experiences and passive vehicle travel. The dynamic nature of the blocking allowed users to maintain situational awareness when needed while still benefiting from symptom reduction.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Provides a practical, wearable solution to motion sickness that could make VR and AR experiences more accessible to users prone to discomfort, expanding the potential user base for immersive technologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Relevance to Grant:</strong> Demonstrates how on-body sensing and adaptive wearable systems can address accessibility barriers in emerging IoT and immersive technology contexts, making these technologies usable for a broader range of users.</p>

        <div class="paper-summary">
            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This workshop paper explores how immersive media technologies (VR, AR, MR) can be leveraged to create more inclusive user interactions. The authors argue that immersive technologies offer unique opportunities to address accessibility challenges by creating alternative interaction paradigms that bypass traditional barriers.</p>

            <p>The workshop brought together researchers and practitioners to discuss design strategies for inclusive immersive experiences. Topics included sensory substitution (translating one sense to another), multimodal feedback systems, adaptive interfaces that respond to user abilities, and embodied interaction techniques that leverage diverse forms of physical engagement.</p>

            <p>Key insights from the workshop highlighted that immersive technologies can support accessibility not just through accommodation (adapting existing interactions) but through transformation (creating entirely new ways of interacting that may be more natural for users with diverse abilities). Examples included spatial audio for navigation by blind users, haptic feedback for deaf users in social VR, and gaze-based interaction for users with limited mobility.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Establishes a research agenda for inclusive design in immersive media, emphasizing that accessibility should be considered from the earliest stages of technology development rather than as an afterthought.</p>

            <p><strong>Relevance to Grant:</strong> Aligns with the grant's vision of inclusive IoT design by exploring how emerging immersive technologies can be designed from the ground up with accessibility in mind, providing frameworks applicable to broader IoT contexts.</p>

            <p><strong>Summary:</strong> This workshop paper documents the fourth iteration of the Eyewear Computing workshop, focusing on democratizing smart eyewear technologies and their application in augmenting social situations. The workshop addressed both technical challenges in eyewear development and social implications of this increasingly prevalent wearable technology.</p>

            <p>Key themes included: (1) Making eyewear computing accessible to broader audiences through open-source hardware and software tools; (2) Understanding social acceptance and privacy concerns around always-on wearable cameras and sensors; (3) Developing interaction techniques suitable for discreet, hands-free operation in social contexts; and (4) Exploring applications beyond individual augmentation to support group activities and social connection.</p>

            <p>The workshop highlighted emerging use cases including real-time language translation for multilingual conversations, subtle attention guidance for social anxiety, memory support for people with cognitive challenges, and shared visual experiences for remote collaboration. Participants emphasized the importance of considering cultural contexts and social norms when designing eyewear applications.</p>

            <p><strong>Key Contribution:</strong> Advances the discourse on eyewear computing from technical feasibility to social integration, addressing practical barriers to adoption including accessibility, affordability, and social acceptability.</p>

            <p><strong>Relevance to Grant:</strong> Directly supports the grant's goals by exploring how smart eyewear—a key platform for on-body sensing and IoT interaction—can be designed inclusively and made accessible to diverse user populations, democratizing access to augmented reality and assistive technologies.</p>
