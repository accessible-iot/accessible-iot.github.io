IoT’s universal impact has a unique potential to serve as an enabling technology for several of the SDGs such as SDG 3, 9 and 11. For IoT to fulfill its potential in advancing social good, accessibility for differently abled users would be essential. People who do not fit the idea of an “average user” (e.g. having some disabilities or being neurodiverse) can benefit immensely from the Internet of Things. For example, mainstream home automation products and services could improve the quality and reduce the cost of custom-made solutions for ambient assisted living, which has been a field of accessibility research and development for decades. However, not considering accessibility in IoT design can further exclude people with different abilities (for example, a touch screen to control the aircon or an home automation smart phone app could be even less accessible than a physical controls, if it does not follow accessibility considerations). Accessibility considerations include the UI design, the protocols and APIs, as well as the subjective user experience.")),(0,s.mdx)(l,{sx:{gridTemplateColumns:["1fr","1fr","1fr 1fr"]},mdxType:"Grid"},(0,s.mdx)(p,{mdxType:"Box"},(0,s.mdx)("h2",null,"Contact"),(0,s.mdx)(u,{variant:"styles.h3",sx:{mb:0},mdxType:"Heading"},"Email"),(0,s.mdx)(f,{href:"mailto:kai (at) kmd.keio.ac.jp",variant:"styles.a",mdxType:"Link"},"kai (at) kmd.keio.ac.jp"),(0,s.mdx)(u,{variant:"styles.h3",sx:{mb:0},mdxType:"Heading"},"Homepage"),(0,s.mdx)(f,{href:"https://kaikunze.de",variant:"styles.a",mdxType:"Link"},"https://kaikunze.de/")),(0,s.mdx)(p,{mdxType:"Box"},(0,s.mdx)("h2",null,"Top 5 tags"),(0,s.mdx)(h,{filter:"posts",mdxType:"SourceTags"},(function(e){return(0,s.mdx)(y,{sx:{flexDirection:"column"},mdxType:"Flex"},e.splice(0,5).sort((function(e,t){return t.percent-e.percent})).map((function(e,t){var i=e.name,n=(e.count,e.percent);return(0,s.mdx)(p,{key:t,sx:{color:"muted",mb:3,svg:{fill:"muted"}},mdxType:"Box"},(0,s.mdx)(y,{sx:{lineHeight:"normal"},mdxType:"Flex"},(0,s.mdx)(g,{sx:{color:"secondary",mr:2,mb:0},mdxType:"Text"},""+i),(0,s.mdx)(g,{sx:{color:"muted"},mdxType:"Text"},n),(0,s.mdx)(g,{sx:{color:"error"},mdxType:"Text"},"%")),(0,s.mdx)(y,{mdxType:"Flex"},(0,s.mdx)(p,{mdxType:"Box"},"["),(0,s.mdx)(p,{sx:{flexBasis:"100%"},mdxType:"Box"},(0,s.mdx)("svg",{xmlns:"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg",viewBox:"0 0 1200 8",width:"100%",height:"8"},(0,s.mdx)("rect",{width:3*n+"%",height:4}))),(0,s.mdx)(p,{mdxType:"Box"}," ","]")))})))})))))}b.isMDXComponent=!0},6063:function(e,t,i){var n=i(7378),s=i(9465),o=i(8068),r=i(7497),a=i(6046),d=i(1891),l=i(2224);t.Z=function(e){var t=e.children,i=(0,l.ZR)().site.siteMetadata,m=i.name,c=i.description,u=i.keywords,x=i.siteUrl,p=i.siteImage,f=i.lang;return(0,s.jsx)(r.H,null,(0,s.jsx)(d.o,null,(0,s.jsx)(o.Location,null,(function(e){var t=e.location.pathname,i=t.replace(/\//gm,"");return(0,s.jsx)(n.Fragment,null,(0,s.jsx)(a.p,{type:"website",title:m,titleTemplate:i,description:c,siteUrl:x,canonical:t,image:p,path:t,keywords:u||[""],lang:f}))})),t))}},808:function(e,t,i){function n(e,t){if(null==e)return{};var i,n,s={},o=Object.keys(e);for(n=0;n<o.length;n++)i=o[n],t.indexOf(i)>=0||(s[i]=e[i]);return s}i.d(t,{Z:function(){return n}})}}]);
